# My Machine Learning Projects

This repository documents my personal learning journey in Machine Learning.
I built these projects while exploring core ML concepts and experimenting
with different algorithms to understand how they work in practice.

Instead of focusing only on outputs, I spent time understanding the logic
behind each model, how parameters affect performance, and where each
algorithm is best suited.

## 📌 What’s inside this repository

The projects are organized in a step-by-step manner, starting from basic
Python tools used in Machine Learning and gradually moving towards more
advanced algorithms and neural networks.

### Topics covered:

- Python fundamentals for Machine Learning  
  (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, data handling and visualization)
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using PyTesseract
- Linear Regression  
  - Implemented from scratch to understand the mathematics behind it
  - Implemented using inbuilt libraries for comparison
- Regularized Linear Regression
- Naïve Bayes classifiers
- Decision Tree models
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Perceptron learning algorithm
- XOR gate implementation using Backpropagation
- Backpropagation Neural Network and K-Means clustering using scikit-learn

Each folder represents a focused experiment where the main goal was
learning and experimentation, not just implementation.
